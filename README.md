🌟 A-TEAM GAME!!! 🚀

At the 4th week of my 14-week intensive Full Stack Programming Bootcamp at Code For All_ 🎓, we (Code cadets) embarked on a thrilling challenge: to develop a game showcasing the fresh skills acquired until that point, in 10 days!

🕹️ This game was brought to life by a team of 5 members 🤝, and we sprinted against time with a mere 10 days to develop and deliver this project. Having our regular classes throughout the day, we juggled absorbing new content and channeling our creativity into this project, in order to deliver it before the deadline!

Since we were the TEAM A, we chose the A-Team theme for a bit of fun! In this game you can take one of the most beloved characters and you have to run away from the police!!! 
You can download the jar file and running on your terminal with the command "java -jar ATeamGame.jar" or running on your IDE.
